            <h1>About Signal Quo</h1>
            <p>
                Signal Quo is an award-winning prototype built by Somewhat
                Questionable. Our team of six claimed a top-place finish at <a
                    href="https://ymcachch.org.nz/grapple/"
                    target="_blank">Grapple23</a
                >, a week-long maker hackathon, held in
                <a href="https://4c.nz/">YMCAâ€™s 4C Centre</a> in Christchurch, New
                Zealand.
            </p>

            <p>
                At Signal Quo, we aim to fortify future Martian missions with an
                empathetic approach to safety and efficiency. We journey into a
                future where Mars isn't merely a neighbouring planet, but a
                second home for humankind. However, this isn't a future devoid
                of challenges. The Martian surface, characterised by frequent
                severe dust storms, embodies an intimidating threat to
                communication - a lifeline for survival on the Red Planet.

            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
                Our team, aptly named "Somewhat Questionable," is a collective
                of dedicated individuals hailing from different parts of New
                Zealand.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="name">Jude Wilson</span> and
                    <span class="name">Sean Jang</span> were the dynamic duo of the
                    team. Calling Auckland home, they worked in tandem on the physical
                    design of our innovative devices, shaping the aesthetics and
                    ergonomics to suit the challenging Martian environment.

                <li>
                    <span class="name">Jasper Miller-Waugh</span> and Taine Reader
                    were our Whangarei whizzes who took on the electronics coding.
                    Jasper worked on writing a streamlined C++ firmware for the devices
                    and developed the geolocation and HopTrace protocol. At the same
                    time, Taine brought his skill set in electronics to create our
                    sensor data logger and live sensor display.

                <li>
                    <span class="name">James Avenell</span> worked his tech magic
                    on the web alert dashboard and ensured secure storage for our
                    sensor data.

                <li>
                    <span class="name">Ara Bartlett</span> helped powered the alert
                    dashboard with her skilled electronics work and ensured we got
                    our message across effectively with her presentation and design
                    efforts.

            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>
                Imagine invaluable human life thriving amidst the daunting
                Martian dust storms, fortified by a resilient communication
                system - that's the future Signal Quo aspires to facilitate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Out of this vision, the Signal Quo system was born - a mesh
                network acting as a secondary communication system for Martian
                colonists, featuring a main hub, personal transmitters, and
                environmental monitoring modules. All these devices are designed
                to function meticulously even during severe dust storms, making
                every EVA safer and more efficient.

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                Our system utilises the Low Range (LoRa) technology for its
                radio communication protocol - not using the internet-expanded
                LoRaWAN version but the raw LoRa radio, focusing on creating a
                network directly serving the specific needs of a Mars colony.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our mesh network consists of nodes that connect and work
                together to expand communication coverage. Each node powers our
                novel HopTrace protocol which accurately captures and records
                all the communication hops, allowing geolocation of devices
                several hops away from the main hub.
